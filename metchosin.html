        The Metchosin Challenge Speaker Series was started in 2017 to demonstrate the church’s involvement with world issues and challenge the community to aware of those issues so they could make better informed decisions and actions.

The theme of the nineth year (2025) is Spirituality in the (Post) Modern World.

March 25th: The Rev Dr. Ross Lockhart will speak on how the very secular Pacific Northwest is different from the rest of the continent and the challenges that it brings. He is from St Andrew’s Hall and Vancouver School of Theology in Vancouver, so will be presenting on Zoom. View recording Here.
April 1st: The Rev Dr. Travis O’Brian will speak on Mystery in the Church; the draw and the role of it in modern faith. View recording Here.
April 8th: Patricia Lane, a lawyer who challenges the churches to be the leaders in the climate and environmental struggles. Patricia will present on how the Canadian Churches can or should respond to President Trump.
