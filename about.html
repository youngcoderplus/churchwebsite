    Welcome to St Mary’s Metchosin.

We’re a member of the Anglican Church of Canada
We are an inclusive church – We welcome every single one of God’s children.

We’re a community church
We have been a part of the Metchosin community since 1873 and we plan on sticking around. Lots of things have changed in 150 years, but God’s love never changes – we welcome you into our community, we accept all, and we welcome your involvement with us.

We’re a family church
We recognize that families come in a kaleidoscope of shapes and sizes and we are happy to include everyone in our worship service.

We are a small church with a big heart.
Now we'd like to get to know you...

            <h2>With Gratitude</h2>
            <p>The Diocese of British Columbia acknowledges that for thousands of years the Coast Salish, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Kwakwaka’wakw peoples have walked gently on the unceded territories where we now live, work, worship, and play. We seek a new relationship with the first peoples here, one based in honour and respect, and we thank them for their hospitality.</p>
